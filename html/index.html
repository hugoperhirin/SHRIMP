        $SHRIMP is a meme coin related to the BFLY Team, characterized by its lack of intrinsic value or any anticipation of financial gains. It operates without a defined team or roadmap and serves solely for entertainment purposes, rendering it entirely devoid of utility. Its sole purpose is to facilitate the achievement of subgoals by the BFLY Team.
