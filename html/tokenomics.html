                Tokenomics are weird and complicated, and can be difficult to understand from a regular users point of
                view
                - we'll try to make it as easy to digest as possible, by providing proper context and transparency.
                <br><br>

                Our tokenomics are designed by us, which means they might be flawed,
                but they are carefully chosen this way because we believe it's the best course of action considering our
                ambitions for SHRIMP.

                    <span class="communitydesc">Community:</span><br><br>
                    Community is sort of a broad term - this allocation includes, but is not limited to:<br><br><br>
                    <div class="communities">
                        <span class="communitiestext">Aptomingos, [REDACTED] Keys and CB ordinals:</span>
                        Our dear loyal supporters - the people who have faith in us. Aptomingos will naturally get the
                        highest allocation, but we'd like to show good faith to both <a href="https://www.mercato.xyz/aptos/collection/redacted-keys?bottomTab=trades&tab=items" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer" class="no-underlinekey">key</a> holders and <a href="https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/clubbizarre" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer" class="no-underlinecb">CB ordinal</a> holders
                        by
                        providing a small allocation to them as well.<br><br><br>

                        <span class="communitiestext">SHRIMP liquidity providers:</span>
                        We'd like to incentivize you guys to provide liquidity for SHRIMP, and we'll be working closely
                        with
                        DEX's to make this a reality.<br><br><br>

                        <span class="communitiestext">Barbecue participants:</span>
                        <a href="/bbq"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="no-underlinebarbecue">The Barbecue</a> is all about rewarding active users
                        who enthusiastically pays attention to our
                        shenanigans, and punish the ones that don't.<br><br><br>

                        <span class="communitiestext">NFT and DeFi communities:</span>
                        The SHRIMP experience isn't gated to our holders only - we're looking to include the entire
                        Aptos
                        ecosystem, and even a few friends from other networks. This means we'll drop an allocation to
                        our
                        NFT and DeFi friends as well. This won't be done in a regular fashion, but we'll provide more
                        context on this front in the near future.<br><br><br>

                        <span class="communitiestext">Galxe participants:</span>

                            rel="noopener noreferrer" class="no-underlinegalxe">Galxe campaigns</a> have been part of a
                        little way to boost our engagement while still
                        educating
                        you guys around the core concepts of SHRIMP. So far, they've been pretty easy, but you never
                        know
                        what might happen in the future.<br><br><br>

                    <span class="reservedesc">Reserve:</span><br><br>
                    This allocation of tokens are specifically set aside for our mechanic called <a href="/reserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="no-underlinereserve">The Reserve</a>. These
                    tokens will only be utilized when we hit certain burn thresholds from <a href="/bbq"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="no-underlinebarbecue">The Barbecue</a>. We highly doubt
                    that we'll utilize the total amount in this category this way, so this allocation will also serve as
                    a backup for things like grants for builders, more airdrops, providing more liquidity,
                    etc.<br><br><br>

                    <span class="lpdesc">LP:</span><br><br>
                    Our initial liquidity pool will consist of 15% of the total supply. We'd like for people to able to
                    trade freely, and sufficient liquidity is the key to that goal.
                    <br><br><br>

                    <span class="investorsdesc">Investors:</span><br><br>
                    We believe we have a good mix of people in our presale round. We've got founders, real products,
                    influential traders, whales, and people who've shown loyalty and faith in us from our humble
                    beginnings. This allocation is vested, and they will have ZERO tokens available to trade on day
                    1.<br><br><br>

                    <span class="daoandteam"><span class="daodesc">DAO </span>&<span class="team">
                            Team:</span></span><br><br>
                    The DAO allocation is for anything we'd like to do as a project.<br><br><br>
                    Think of this allocation as a jack-of-all-trades.
                    Team allocation is sort of self-explanatory, we'd like to be involved in the process and experience
                    of
                    SHRIMP,
                    while also being paid for the work we've done over the past couple of months.<span class="team">Team</span> allocation is
                    vested,
                    similar to presale.<br><br><br>

                    We retain the right to drop these allocations as we see fit, and we've already explained that not
                    everything will be dropped at once.
                    We'd like a healthy circulating supply, which means things might be done slowly, and might be
                    adjusted
                    as we go.
